    "content": "Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or disrupt normal operations. It plays a critical role in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems.",

    "section": "2. History and Evolution",
    "content": "The concept of cybersecurity dates back to the 1970s with the emergence of the first computer worms and viruses. Over the decades, as computing technology advanced and became more interconnected through the internet, the scope and scale of threats also evolved. This led to the emergence of more advanced security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and now AI-powered defense mechanisms.",
